#Description
Contained in this project are various small pieces of code that have been written along my journey to learn javascript and more specifically node.js.
If you're reading this and see anything that I could do to improve don't hesitate to let me know!

##Project Contents
Brief descriptions of the intentions of each package (are they called packages in js..?).
###calc
The first package written that initially added up an array of numbers but now takes user input and displays all the prime numbers up to the input value with some light validation.
###read-file
Contains files to print this README.md file to console.out and print some information about a few of the files in the project using node's file services library.
###http
Contains files to create basic http servers and print some text to the screen.
###handlebars
Simple express-handlebars project to display my name on the screen... yeah...
